# open-ventilator
open source mechanical ventilator for educational purposes

### background
The goal of this project is to build a simple mechanical ventilator that facilitates understanding of the mechanics and technology in modern ventilators. The purpose is pedagogical; this is not intended for medical or veterinary use.

The ideal project would be able to demonstrate:
- volume control ventilation
- pressure control ventilation
- simple maneuvers (plateau pressure)
- rudimentary alarms (peak pressure alarm, low volume alarm, etc)
- a simple graphical display (either via serial connection to a computer or on a small attached LCD dispay)

### components

- mechanical pump
- pneumotachymeter
- pressure sensor
- inspiratory/expiratory valve


### ideas
- use an open source pump as a starting point; for example the [programmable-air](https://www.crowdsupply.com/tinkrmind/programmable-air) project includes a simple hardware and [arduino compatible software package](https://github.com/programmable-air/code).
